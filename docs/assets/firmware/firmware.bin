PLACEHOLDER FOR FIRMWARE BINARY

To use the Web Flasher:
1. Compile the firmware using PlatformIO.
2. Run `pio run --target=mergebin` (or manually merge bootloader, partitions, and app).
   Alternatively, for simple updates, just the application binary might suffice if offsets are correct, but 0x0 requires a full merged image.
3. Rename the output file to `firmware.bin`.
4. Place it in this directory (`docs/assets/firmware/`).
